# Advent of Code
My solution to the Advent of Code. 

# Personal Goals
2022: I firstly attempted all puzzles in Python to learn the language.

2023: I attempted all puzzles in F# to learn the language, but it wasn't my thing.

2024: I tackle all puzzles in Python and try TDD.

2025: Stay fluent in Java.

# Lessons Learned
- Day 3: Broke the TDD-cycle and tried to implement a regex directly. Bad idea! :)
